*****Test Strategy*****
1. Gather high level information about prime no.
2. Thought About false test cases.
3. Test condition for 0 and 1
4. test condition for number less than zero.
5. Test condition for  prime number.

*****Test Cases******
1. If user enters less zero then it results to be false i.e. the number is not prime number.
2. If user enter zero or one the it results to be false i.e. the number is not prime number.
3. If number is exactly divisible by one and itself it results to be true i.e. the number is  prime number.


*****Program Execution Flow*****

1. Implemented function for the isPrimeNo().
2. When user enters any number , the function invokes and passes through the condition if condition fails then it returns false
   otherwise false.
3. In main we are calling isPrimeNo() function in assert.
