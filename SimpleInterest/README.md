1. Developed this code for calculating Simple Interest.

*****Test Cases for Simple Interest Calculator*****

1. If we enter principal, rate and year as zero then it simply print the actual values of the variables.
Output:
Principal: 0
Rate : 0
Year : 0
Simple Interest : 0

2. If we enter all values greater than zero then it will print principal amount, year, rate of interest as well as Simple Interest.
Output:
The Simple Interest for : 
Principal : 1000
Rate : 8.5
Year : 2
Simple Interest : 170

3. If we enter any of negative value then it will gives absolute of that value then it will print principal amount, year rate of interest as well as Simple Interest.
Input:
Principal : -1000
Rate : -8.5
Year : -2
output:
The Simple Interest for : 
Principal : 1000
Rate : 8.5
Year : 2
Simple Interest : 170

*****Test Strategy*****
1. Heads up with the logic of code.
2. Think about the test cases. 





Flow:
1. Declared the class containing private data members and member function.
2. Created the instance of class in main and initialized the values of data members with the helped of constructor.
3. Call that member function( calculateSimpleInterest()) on the instance of class and the function executes.
