*****Test Strategy*****

1. find the square root of number using sqrt() in cmath library.

2. In main function write the code inside the try block to catch any exception is occur at the time of running program.

3. Write a function findSquartRoot() in that check the condition for negative number or for zero.


******Test Cases*****

1. Zero has not a square root.

2. Negative number does not  have  square root.

3. If user input a invalid input then it will give and exception i.e :- "Invalid Input" or with custom exception message.

Example for Input:- 
1) Enter the Number :- jkl
   Inavlid input

2) Enter the Number :- -56
   Cannot find the squart root of negative number.

3) Enter the Number :- 0
   Zero has not a square root

4)Enter the Number :- 56.23
  Squart root of 56.23 is :- 7.49867

5)Enter the Number :- 64
  Squart root of 64 is :- 8
