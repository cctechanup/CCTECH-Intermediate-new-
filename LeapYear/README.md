*****Test Strategies*****

1. Over viewed the concept of leap year.

2. Dry preparation of test cases.



*****Test Cases*****

1. If year % 400 is exactly equals to zero then leap year.

2. If year % 100 is exactly equals to zero then leap year.

3. If year % 4 is exactly equals to zero then leap year.

4. otherwise it will not leap year.





Flow:

1. In main, user enter the year.
2. then in checkLeapYear function, checking that year is modulus of 400 or 100 or 4 if it is exactly equal to zero then leap year otherwise not leap year.
